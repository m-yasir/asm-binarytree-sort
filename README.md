# Binary Tree Sort
A fun little assembly language program I wrote during the course "Microprocessor and Assembly Language" during second year of my university.

## Program Details:

**Algorithm:**

- Initialises hard coded array to sort.
- Constructs a binary tree (the array indices method).
- Performs inorder traversal and places visited node's value at output array indices.

**NOTE:** The program was created for and tested on emu8086.

**Improvements (?)**
- The program can be changed to take input from the console instead of them being hard-coded. It can handle more or less elements just *hard-coded*.
- Show input and output on console.
- ???
- Profit
